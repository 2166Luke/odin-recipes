    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Milk: 2 Cups</li>
        <li>Honey: 2 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Active Dry Yeast: 2 & 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li>Large Egg: 1</li>
        <li>Melted Unsalted Butter: 4 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Bread Flour: 5 Cups</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt: 1 & 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Cornmeal for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk and honey in a saucepan and heat to 105-115 degrees Fahrenheit then remove from heat. 
            Add the yeast and allow to sit for five minutes until frothy. 
            Once five minutes has passed whisk in egg and melted butter. </li>
        <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, then slowly pour in the liquid ingredients while mixing. 
            Continue mixing until the dough turns smooth and tacky.</li>
        <li>Scrape the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, and brush the top with a bit of oil. 
            Cover tightly with plastic wrap or a damp towl and allow to rise for one hour or until doubled.</li>
        <li>Take your dough and divide into two halves and then divide those halves into eight pieces to make sixteen 
            larger muffins or eleven each to make twenty-two smaller muffins.</li>
        <li>Take the divided dough and begin to roll them into balls and then flatten those balls into disks. Transfer your disks to baking sheets lined with 
            parchment paper and dusted with cornmeal. Dust cornmeal on top of the rounds and cover with a dish towel and let rise for another hour.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 325 degrees and begin to heat a skillet on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, brown the tops and bottoms of your muffins in the skillet. Cooking each side for 2-5 minutes or until golden brown. Then, return muffins 
            to the baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>After browning, bake the muffins in the oven until a thermometer inserted into the side reads 200 degrees. Finally, remove and allow to cool completely.</li>
